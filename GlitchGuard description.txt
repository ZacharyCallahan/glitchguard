Description:

This project is going to be a Bug tracker for Applications that users are building. 
They can make "Guards" for each application. Then proceed to make a list for whatever they want (features, bugs, ideas, etc). 
Then they can add a list of task that need to be done for those list. The users will also be able to add other users to their guards,
so they can collaborate.

Also wordage will be changed in majority of the website. I have yet to come up with something intriguing.

The wireframe include addition notes of certain features!
